##Objectives

* Design a RESTful JSON API

* Contrast how Handlebars can refactor your code
* Send data to the API and, on success, maintain state between the DB and the DOM
* Deleting, Updating and Editing through Ajax

##WDI Presentation

###Demo

* Show how the app responds to our AJAX requests with the exact data it needs

1. * Make an AJAX GET request to /users/:id/invitations
2. * When the responce is recieved we will need to append the data to the page:
3. * Create an empty unordered list
4. * Loop through the AJAX response and on each iteration create an li that contains the event title, location, organiser and time - based on the events data, which is the parent of invitation. 
5. * We then append the li to the ul
6. * After all the li's have been appended to the ul, we append the ul to the list. 

##Discussion Points

* The differences between a typical API and a JSON API
* What are the implications of have a centralized API? 
* SPA CRUD: Single-page app's (SPAs) are made possible due to asynchronicity. They provide fluid user experiences akin to native applications.
